OnUpdate() - Battle state updates (called by event handlers, not directly tested)
Battle escalation logic (tested via settings)

Summary: Phase 2 Complete - Added 30 new tests for playback controls and battle system. Total: 342 tests (all passing).
Coverage increased from ~55% to ~65%.

🟡 MEDIUM PRIORITY - Zone System (✅ COMPLETED - Phase 3)
ZoneEvents.lua:

Soundtrack_ZoneEvents_AddZones() - Zone initialization ✅ 5 tests (full hierarchy, priorities, instance, arena, nil handling)
OnUpdate() - Zone change detection ✅ 2 tests (enabled/disabled zone music)
Zone name parsing logic ✅ Tested (4 existing tests for parsing)
Continent/zone hierarchy ✅ 1 test (4-level hierarchy creation)
Instance/Arena detection ✅ 2 tests (instance, arena/PvP flags)
Priority assignment ✅ 1 test (ST_CONTINENT_LVL through ST_MINIMAP_LVL)

🟡 MEDIUM PRIORITY - Library Management (✅ COMPLETED - Phase 3)
Library.lua - Track Database:

AddDefaultTrack() - Adds default (non-custom) track ✅ 1 test (default flag setting)
OnUpdate() - Library update tick (fade-in/fade-out, track progression) ✅ 2 tests (stack level zero, fade-out flag)
Track file path resolution (mp3/ogg/wav) ✅ 3 tests (OGG/MP3/default path handling)
Fade-out logic ✅ 1 test (non-continuous events)
Continuity system (seamless track transitions) ✅ 1 test (continuous events with continuity timer)
Priority: Track loading bugs could cause silent failures or wrong files playing.

Summary: Phase 3 Complete - Added 16 new tests (8 Zone system + 8 Library management). Total: 362 tests (all passing).
Coverage increased from ~65% to ~70%.

🟡 MEDIUM PRIORITY - Addon Initialization
Soundtrack.lua:

LoadTracks() - Main track loading ❌ No tests (except popup mock)
OnUpdate() - Main addon update loop ❌ No tests
OnLoad() - Addon initialization ❌ No tests
Default settings initialization ⚠️ Framework test only (not real code)
Migration from old saved variables ❌ No tests
Priority: Init bugs affect every user session. Migration bugs could lose user data.

✅ Event deletion - DeleteEvent, verify cleanup

✅ Phase 2 (High Priority - COMPLETED):
✅ Playback controls - Next/Previous/Pause/Stop tests (19 tests added)
✅ Battle system core - Combat state, death handling, event triggering (11 tests added)
✅ PlayRandomTrackByTable - Random vs sequential, offset handling, edge cases (8 tests)

✅ Phase 3 (Medium Priority - COMPLETED):
✅ Zone system - Zone detection, hierarchy, OnUpdate, instance/arena detection (8 tests added)
✅ Library OnUpdate - Fade logic, continuity system, path resolution (8 tests added)

Phase 4 (Low Priority - If time allows):
Addon initialization - OnLoad, LoadTracks, migration logic
Edge cases - Null handling, error conditions, cleanup
Integration tests - End-to-end scenarios combining multiple systems

Phase 4 (Polish):
