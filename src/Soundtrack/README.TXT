QUICK SETUP

Method A:

1. Locate the folder named SoundtrackMusic in the Addons folder.
   (World of Warcraft\Interface\AddOns\SoundtrackMusic)

2. Copy your mp3s to that folder, and close WoW if it's already open. 
   Files added while WoW is running won't be noticed until you restart it.
   You can organize your music into subfolders, e.g. 
    \SoundtrackMusic\Lord of the Rings\
    \SoundtrackMusic\Pokemon\
    \SoundtrackMusic\Public Enemy\
    and so on.

3. To make your mp3s available in the game, go into the Music Manager folder
   and run GenerateMyLibraryWindows.jar. Go to Options > Generate My Library.

   Please wait until it finishes before closing the window.

   If the Java applet fails to run for whatever reason, you can alternatively install
   Python 2.6 and run GenerateMyLibrary.py, located in this folder.

Method B:

1. Locate and run GenerateMyLibraryWindows.jar in Soundtrack\Music Manager.

2. From there, in the Options menu, add individual mp3s or folders containing mp3s to the list. 
   Close WoW if it's already open. Junctions are enabled by default, which is like making a 
   shortcut to the files instead of copying them.

3. When you've added everything you want, select Generate My Library.
